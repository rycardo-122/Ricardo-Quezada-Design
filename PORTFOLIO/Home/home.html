                Aphex Twin Come to daddy poster- For this design I wanted to focus on the use of typography while embedding some imagery that showcases the visual language of this artist.

We built an elongated version of the chair, we then implemented hinges in the middle which help with splitting up the chair. These hinhes allow one side of the chair to fold open into another chair allowing two users to interact with the U-chair at once.  </p>

                        <p>During the summer of 2020 I enrolled into a UX/UI bootcamp at UC Irvine where I was able to learn about user research and interface design. During the last few weeks of this course my team and I which consited of 4 people worked on complete website redesign. We noticed that the website was lacking several things that are pivotal for a good user experience. The main thing that we wanted to do to fix the site was to make it accessible for all tyoes of users who might have dissabilities.</p>

                        <p>We also focused on organizing the site to make more sense when navigating through the nav bar. The user flow of this site was fixed after we conducted a few user tests on the old site and then on our demos which were lofi iterations of the original site. Lastly we implemented a more aesthetics and made the site responsive which at the made the website look more professianl.   </p>
